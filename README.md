# Vocabulary checking helper 
This repo is used to store all my materials and resources for the GRE paper 

**Vocabulary list**
Vocabulary is from three main resources:  
   + GRE Vocabulary Flashcards - Magoosh GRE  
   https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks
   + 1000 words Manhattan vocab list
   https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1wehmxu7Ee5zqTGPiHdpeAw_Ib3iHvfyP
   + Words smart for the GRE (Princeton review) about 200 words 

**Bucket vocab**
Each bucket.csv contains 25 words from those 3 sources. 
My goal is to learn 1 bucket/2 days 
- bucket.csv is extracted from my Notion and Anki app:
